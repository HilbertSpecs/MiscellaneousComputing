# MiscellaneousComputing
Included in This Repository are some Simple Scientific Computing Applications.
All Applications (.cpp files) are stand alone programs and can be simply compiled and run individually.
Some .txt/.dat files have been included as sample program output.

1. BasisDiscretization.cpp: used for griding out an Indepentdent Basis vector in user-defined Step-Size.
2. BinaryBasisGenerator.cpp: is a binary counter from 0 to N basis vectors.
3. N_DimCoinFilp.cpp: is used to generate random 64-bit length Binary Strings.
4. RandomWalker_3D.cpp: A Random 3D Walker.
5. TimeStamp.cpp: A timestamp generator.
